This repository contains step by step guides, written in markdown, about setting up and configuring a virtual private server (VPS). The guides are separated into different files and folders based on what they cover. As of now, the guides are only for Ubuntu and specific configurations.

This repository also contains a guide for Linneaus students on how to set up and configure the CSCloud server that they get access to during the courses: 1dv025, 1dv026, and 1dv027.
